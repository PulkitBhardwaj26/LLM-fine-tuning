# LLM-fine-tuning
Fine-tuned LLaMA models for task-specific behavior and controlled responses, exploring instruction-tuning and alignment challenges.


What This Project Does
This project takes open-source AI language models (like LLaMA) and customizes them to follow instructions better, stay on topic, and avoid unwanted responses. Think of it like "training a smart assistant to actually do what you ask."

Key Parts

Fine-Tuning: Adjusts a pre-trained model using small, efficient tweaks (not full retraining) to make it better at specific tasks.

Alignment Testing: Checks where the model fails (like giving harmful or off-topic replies) and tries to fix it.

Control: Focuses on making the AI safer and more predictable for real-world use.

Why It Matters
Most AI models are general-purposeâ€”this makes them specialized, reliable, and safer for practical uses like customer support or education.

For Tech Folks
Uses techniques like LoRA (parameter-efficient tuning) and instruction-tuning datasets. Built with Python/HuggingFace.
